1. In order to enable login, we have to install next auth V5 inside of our project

Callback: To extend the session object ({"user":{"name":"test","email":"test@mail.com","image":null}}),"expires":"2024-09-20T07:02:22.048Z"}) 
with couple of more staffes like id, role, bunch of more things inside of our session. next-auth has callbacks which can do that.

Before we can extend the session, we have to extend jwt which returns our token because 
session uses the token to generate the session

Callbacks are asynchronous functions we can use to control what happens when an action is performed.
